## Mean, Median, and Mode

### Mean
The mean is the average of a set of numbers, calculated by dividing the sum of all values by the number of values.

### Median
The median is the middle value in a list of numbers, which separates the higher half from the lower half.

### Mode
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set.

## Percentiles
Percentiles are measures that indicate the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall.

## Data Distribution
Data distribution describes the way in which data values are spread out or clustered together.

## Normal Distribution
The normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.

## Multiple Regression
Multiple regression is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable.

## Scaling
Scaling involves adjusting the range of data values to a standard range, typically 0 to 1 or -1 to 1, to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

## Train and Test Data
Splitting data into training and testing sets is crucial for evaluating the performance of machine learning models. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.

## Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm, showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

## Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters.

## Categorical Data
Categorical data represents variables that can take on one of a limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values, assigning each individual or other unit of observation to a particular group or nominal category.

## Cross Validation
Cross-validation is a technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. It is mainly used in settings where the goal is prediction and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice.
